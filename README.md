# WeatherApp
 This weather app, built with React and Material-UI, allows users to search for real-time weather data by city. It displays temperature, humidity, and a description of current conditions. Background images dynamically change based on the weather. Data is fetched from the OpenWeather API, offering a simple and responsive design.
